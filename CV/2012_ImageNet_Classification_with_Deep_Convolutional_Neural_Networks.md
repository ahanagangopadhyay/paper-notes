With well over 50,000 citations till date, this 2012 paper by Geoffrey Hinton's group at University of Toronto is a seminal paper in computer vision and regarded as one of the papers that established Convolutional Neural Networks in the forefront for image classification tasks. A variant of the deep CNN proposed here was entered in the ILSVRC (ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge) 2012, which won with a top-5 error rate of 15.3%, largely outperforming the second-place winner (26.2%).
