# paper-notes
This repository contains my notes on the papers I read as I try to acquint myself with seminal papers in machine learning, neuromorphic algorithms and other related topics. 

**ML**: General machine learning papers  

- [Learning without feedback: Direct Random Target Projection as a Feedback-Alignment Algorithm with Layerwise Feedforward Training](https://github.com/ahanagangopadhyay/paper-notes/blob/master/ML/ML_without_backprop/2019_Learning_Without_Feedback:_Direct_Random_Target_Projection.md), arXiv 2019
- [Deep Sparse Rectifier Neural Networks](https://github.com/ahanagangopadhyay/paper-notes/blob/master/ML/2011_Deep_Sparse_Rectifier_Neural_Networks.md), JMLR 2011

**NA**: Neuromorphic machine learning papers  



**CV**  Computer Vision papers:

- [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://github.com/ahanagangopadhyay/paper-notes/blob/master/CV/2012_ImageNet_Classification_with_Deep_Convolutional_Neural_Networks.md), NIPS 2012
