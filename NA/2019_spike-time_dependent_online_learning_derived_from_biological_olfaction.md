The authors propose a fully feedforward spiking neural network which uses principles from mammalian olfactory systems for signal restoration and classification. The learning rule is spike-time based, exhibits high classification accuracy after few-shot learning, and includes a none-of-the-above outcome to reflect classifier confidence. They demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a machine olfaction dataset, where the challenges include relatively small training sets, variable stimulus concentrations and considerable sensor drift.
