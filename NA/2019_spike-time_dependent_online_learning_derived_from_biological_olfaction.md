The authors propose a fully feedforward spiking neural network which uses principles from mammalian olfactory systems for signal restoration and classification. The learning rule is spike-time based, exhibits high classification accuracy after few-shot learning, and includes a none-of-the-above outcome to reflect classifier confidence. They demonstrate the performance of the algorithm on a machine olfaction dataset, where the challenges include relatively small training sets, variable stimulus concentrations and considerable sensor drift.

Mostly, research in machine olfaction is devoted to sensor development, using technologies like MOS, high-density polymer sensors, surface acoustic wave sensors, etc. In contrast, the authors dedicated their efforts to the post-sensory networks of the biological olfactory system, and tried to extract and implement the computational principles that yield its unmatched performance.
